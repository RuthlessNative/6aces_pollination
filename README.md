# 6aces_pollination

Welcome! For our third and final project, the Six Aces, wanted to continue with the nutritional them.  In this project we are going to talk about pollination. Pollination is the process of transferring pollen grains from the male part of a plant to a female part of a plant.  This allows fertilization and the production of seeds, most often done by an animal or by wind. 

With information obtained from our resources, we compiled the following analysis:
1. Visual analysis of honey production and number of Colonies per State
2. Pollinators by counties in Georgia
3. SVR Machine Learning Model to predict the honey production of your colony
4. Charts on how stressors to pollinators like bees vary by states and how honey production varies by pesticide use

We utilized Python, Tableau, VS Code, CSS, Bootstrap, and Heroku.
